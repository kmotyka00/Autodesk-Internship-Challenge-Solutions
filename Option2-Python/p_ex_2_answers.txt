What kind of error handling would you implement?
I would implement checking for user input and making sure that the provided number of points is a number.
I would also implement checking if the points create triangle.

How to validate that the triangle is valid?
We have to make sure that all the points don't lie on one line. We can check if the area of the triangle is greater than 0.

How to speed up the algorithm to avoid calculating all possible combinations?
O(n^2) algorithm exists which:
 1. For each pair of points we constract a vertex v.
 2. We find the line through the third point which is vertically closest to v (thus we do not have to search all the points which reduces complexity).
 3. We calculate the area of this triangle and update smallest triangle if the area is smaller that previously searched.
